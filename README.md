# Mapping_Earthquakes

This repository shows a multilayer earthquake map with tectonic plate overlays, pulling all recent (past 7 days) earthquake data worldwide including a map layer for major (4.5+ magnitude) earthquakes.  GeoJSON data is used to populate the map, as well as JavaScript and Leaflet.js tools.
